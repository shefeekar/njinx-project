# njinx-project for static website shefeek2.com





This configuration file is used to set up a server block for hosting a website on a GitHub server. The server block specifies the server's behavior, including the port to listen on, the server name, the root directory for serving files, and the default index file.
Here is a breakdown of the configuration file:



server {
    listen 80;                                             # Specifies the port to listen on (port 80 in this case)
    server_name shefeek2.com;               # Defines the server name or domain name for this server block
    root /usr/share/nginx/html/shefeek2.com/html;   # Specifies the root directory where the website files are located
    index index.html;                    # Defines the default index file to be served when accessing the root URL
}




To use this configuration file, you need to have an NGINX server installed. The server block specified in the file should be added to the NGINX configuration file, usually located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or in a separate file within the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory.

Ensure that the NGINX server is properly configured and running, and then copy the configuration block into the appropriate location. Make sure to update the server_name directive with your own domain or server name.

After adding the configuration, save the file and restart the NGINX server to apply the changes. This can typically be done by running the command sudo service nginx restart or sudo systemctl restart nginx.

Once the server is running and the configuration is in place, you can access your website by entering the server's domain or IP address in a web browser. The server will serve files from the specified root directory, with the default index file being index.html. Make sure your website files are located in the correct directory.

Index File

The index file for this server is index.html. It serves as the default page when accessing the domain shefeek2.com. The contents of the index file are as follows:
"This is the end"
This sentence will be displayed when accessing the server's domain.
